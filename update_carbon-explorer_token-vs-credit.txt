Update Prompt — carbon-explorer — Dual‑ledger tabs (Credits | Tokens)

Context
This update enforces a crisp separation between **Credits (off‑chain, authoritative)** and **Tokens (on‑chain representations)** across UI, APIs, storage, and logs. Avoid ambiguous terminology. Always render provenance (who is the source of record).

1) IA & Routing
- Split into `/credits/*` and `/tokens/*`; default to `/credits`.

2) Theme
- Credits: green; Tokens: purple. Header capsule announces authority + environment/network.

3) Components
- Dual ProofPanel (left CREDIT, right TOKEN). Provenance pill reflects current tab.

4) Tests
- E2E ensure theme & banner switch when tabs change.
